# EIC Lab Content Management

The website uses Pages CMS as a visual editor for the Markdown content stored
in this repository. The website remains an Astro site, GitHub remains the
source of truth, and every saved CMS edit is recorded in Git history.

## One-time connection

1. Push `.pages.yml` to the `main` branch.
2. Open <https://app.pagescms.org/> and sign in with GitHub.
3. Install the Pages CMS GitHub App for
   `kyounghomin/kyounghomin.github.io` only.
4. Open the repository and select the `main` branch.
5. Confirm that News, Gallery, Members, Publications, Research, Funded
   projects, and Notes appear in the editor.

The repository owner must complete the GitHub App installation. No GitHub
token or CMS secret belongs in this repository.

## Editor access

Editors should use their own GitHub accounts. Give each editor write access to
the repository, then have them sign in to Pages CMS with that account. Remove
repository access when someone no longer manages lab content.

## Publishing workflow

1. Open <https://www.kyounghomin.com/admin/>.
2. Enter the relevant collection and create or edit an item.
3. Review required fields, image selection, date, and display order.
4. Save the entry.
5. Pages CMS commits the change to `main` under the editor's identity.
6. GitHub Actions builds and deploys the updated Astro site automatically.

Deployment normally takes a few minutes. Progress is available from the
Deployment status link on the admin gateway or from the repository's Actions
tab.

## Content conventions

- News summaries should be one or two concise sentences.
- News can include an optional full story and up to 10 slideshow images. Add
  slideshow images through the News images field; their selected order is their
  display order in the pop-up.
- Use descriptive filenames for news images and prefer landscape images when
  possible. Portrait images are shown in full without cropping.
- Member portraits should be square. Aim for at least 1200 x 1200 pixels.
- Display names do not need to be unique. When creating a second member with
  the same name, add a short unique suffix in the filename field (for example,
  `minjun-kim-phd-2026`). The filename is the member's stable ID and cannot be
  renamed later because Notes may refer to it.
- The member role controls the program group shown on `/members` and `/game`.
  Use **Include in member roulette** to exclude an active member from the
  roulette without removing their public profile. Alumni never enter the
  roulette.
- Gallery images should be landscape 4:3. Aim for at least 1600 x 1200 pixels.
- Prefer WebP or optimized JPEG files and keep individual images below 2 MB.
- Use display order only to arrange entries within the same role, year, or
  section. Lower numbers appear first.
- Feature only the strongest gallery images in the home page carousel.
- Leave optional fields empty instead of entering placeholder text or `#`.
- For Notes, fill in Title and Summary, then write the article in the prominent
  Post body editor. Use Editor mode for visual writing or Source mode for
  Markdown; images can be inserted directly from the Notes media library.
- Choose Note authors from Members in display order. The picker shows each
  person's name, role, and stable member ID, so duplicate names are safe. The
  public byline uses each member's portrait; members without one use the
  placeholder image.

## Recovery

Every edit is a Git commit. If an entry is changed or deleted accidentally,
restore the previous version through GitHub's file history or revert the CMS
commit. Do not force-push `main`.

## Local validation

Before publishing configuration or template changes, run:

```sh
npm run build
```

Content editors do not need to run the site locally for normal CMS updates.
